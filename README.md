# Car-Sales-Trends-Analysis-Using-Power-BI

# Overview
This project uses Power BI to analyze car sales data, exploring trends in models, transmission types, fuel preferences, and sales years. The goal was to transform raw data into interactive visualizations that reveal actionable insights for the automotive industry. Whether you're a data enthusiast or a hiring manager, this repository showcases my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Dataset
The dataset includes:

Model: Car models (e.g., Toyota Camry, Ford F-150).
Transmission: Manual or automatic.
Fuel Type: Gasoline, diesel, hybrid, electric.
Year: Sales data across multiple years.
The original data had inconsistencies (e.g., repetitive "All" entries), which I cleaned to ensure accuracy.

Process
Data Cleaning: Imported the dataset into Power BI, removed duplicates, and handled missing values using Power Query.
Analysis: Grouped data by year and fuel type to identify trends.
Visualization: Built an interactive dashboard with:
Bar chart: Top-selling car models.
Line graph: Sales trends by year.
Pie chart: Fuel type distribution.
Slicer: Filter by transmission type.
Insights: Linked visuals for drill-down analysis (e.g., hybrid sales for automatic transmissions in 2023).
Key Findings
Top Models: Mid-size sedans and SUVs led sales, with electric models rising steadily.
Fuel Trends: Hybrid and electric sales grew by 25% from 2022 to 2024.
Transmission: Automatic transmissions dominated (80%), with manual holding niche appeal.
Sales Peak: 2023 saw the highest sales, likely due to post-pandemic demand.
Tools & Skills
Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
Data Analysis: Exploratory analysis and trend identification.
Data Cleaning: Power Query for preprocessing.
